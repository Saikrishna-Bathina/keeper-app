## 🧩 Problems Users May Face & How to Resolve Them

### 1. ⚠️ Notes Disappear After Refresh
- **Why?** The app doesn't use persistent storage like localStorage or a database.
- **How to Fix:** In future versions, use `localStorage` or connect to a backend like Firebase or MongoDB to store notes permanently.

---

### 2. ⚠️ Accidentally Deleted a Note
- **Why?** The current delete action has no confirmation.
- **How to Fix:** Add a confirmation dialog or "Undo" feature so users can recover accidentally deleted notes.

---



### 4. ⚠️ Long Notes Overflow the Card
- **Why?** Cards have a fixed size and large content overflows.
- **How to Fix:** Limit characters or add scrollable content area inside each card.

---

### 5. ⚠️ No Way to Edit a Note
- **Why?** Edit functionality hasn’t been implemented.
- **How to Fix:** Future updates can include an “Edit” button that allows inline or modal-based editing.
